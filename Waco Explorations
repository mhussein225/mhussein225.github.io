    <h1>Welcome to Waco!</h1>
    <h2>Waco, Texas is a beautiful place to live!</h2>
    <p>I moved to Waco two years ago from Dallas, Texas. At first I thought this was a boring place, so I didn't do much the first year and a half.</p>
    <p>However, as I started getting to know my coworkers and developing new relationships I started going out more.</p>
    <p> We've been to a lot of great places and restaurants. We are really big on supporting small local businesses in our little town.</p>
    <p>The population of Waco, Texas is 141,936 in 2021. It is about 101 miles and the average income is a little under $60,000. Below is a picture of downtown Waco! </p>
